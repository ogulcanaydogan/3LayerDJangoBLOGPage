Hi 

- I have coded a blog app. Users can publish their blog pages which have their comments, movie or picture files. 

- Movie and picture files are kept on S3 as object. You should create an S3 bucket and write name of it on "/src/cblog/settings.py" file as AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME variable. In addition, you must assign region of S3 as AWS_S3_REGION_NAME variable. 

- Users credentials and blog contents are going to be kept on RDS database. To connect ECs to RDS, following variables must be assigned on "/src/cblog/settings.py" file after you create RDS;
    a. Database name - "NAME" variable 
    b. Database endpoint - "HOST" variables
    c. Port - "PORT"
    d. PASSWORD variable must be written on "/src/.env" file not to be exposed with settings file

- I need to look object list of S3. That's why, I decided to create a DynamoDB table. I have thought to use Lambda function for this purpose and also I have written python code. However, I need help to create Lambda function to manage this serverless process. You can find our python function as lambda_function.py within github repo.

- Since my first aim is to keep our environment in highly secure environment, I want you to establish this infrastructure in our own VPC. 

Thanks Good Luck
